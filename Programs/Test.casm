NOP ; It is good to Start with a NOP for reasons...
MOV AX, 10 ; We move 10 to First Register.
INC AX; Increment AX, so now it is 11.
OUT AX ;We see if the Result Matches.
MOV [4], AX ; Write to Memory Address 4 the 11.
MOV BX, [4] ; Back to BX.
OUT BX ; Output BX.
HALT ; And we finish the execution.
